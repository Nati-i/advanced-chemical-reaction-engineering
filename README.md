# Chemical Reaction Engineering

This repository focuses on mass transfer processes involving multiphase chemical reaction systems:

- Gas-Liquid
- Gas-Solid
- Gas-Liquid-Solid

The interaction between mass transfer and reaction kinetics is modelled for several types of chemical reactors. The model includes conversions, selectivities and product yields all accounting the effects of residence time distribution, mass transfer, reaction kinetics, equilibra and energetic effects.
